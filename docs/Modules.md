# Modules

Modules of Arisa. Arisa periodically checks for newly created Jira issues and updates to existing issues and then
invokes modules for these issues.

When a module is invoked it checks whether any action is needed for an issue, its comments or attachments. Each module
performs one specific task. The execution of a module can be customized through the
[config file](../config/config.yml)

## AffectedVersionMessage

| Entry | Value                                                                                     |

| Class | [Link](../src/main/kotlin/io/github/mojira/arisa/modules/AffectedVersionMessageModule.kt) |

Adds a message comment when an issue has a specific version as affected version. However, unlike other modules this
module does not perform any other action, it neither removes the version nor resolves the issue. This module is
intended for versions which are often erroneously added by users.

The map from Jira version ID to message key is specified as `versionIdMessageMap` in the [config](../config/config.yml)
(defaults to empty map).

### Checks

- The issue has been created after the last run.
- The issue has not been created by a staff member (helper, moderator or Mojang employee).
