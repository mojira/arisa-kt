## About the project

Arisa is a Bot account on Mojira, Mojang's bug tracker. Its purpose is to run various checks on tickets and execute
automated tasks.
For instance, it automatically analyzes newly posted tickets and automatically resolves them in case the game is
modified.

Arisa was [originally written in Ruby](https://github.com/mojira/arisa) by Synchunk, a now retired Mojira moderator.
Later, Arisa was [rewritten in JavaScript](https://github.com/mojira/arisa-js) by [Mustek](https://github.com/Mustek).
This Kotlin version of Arisa was written by [urielsalis](https://github.com/urielsalis).
